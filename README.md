## Research Goal 

What are the key components in differentiating between positive and negative game reviews?

## Background
Businesses use the internet to offer available products for real time sales to consumers. The analytics pipeline from this supply chain involves the collection of customer ratings and reviews of the products. This yields a vast collection of unstructured data with valuable information that would be lost without a systematic workflow for processing the data for business intelligence (Forman et al. 2008). Text mining can be utilized to gain understanding about the consumersâ€™ thoughts/feelings from past purchases and interactions with the company (Liu, 2012). 

## Research Questions
1)	How does one identify frequently used words of phrases in top rated game reviews to characterize the difference of attributes between games with higher rating scores?
2)	How does the structure and function contribute to the necessary information for determining whether a game is highly rated and/or contains a greater amount of positive reviews from a popular online board game store?

This information could assist game developers in better understanding the attributes that should be included in new games by exploring the historical data which yield positive reviews. Combining the insight gained from maximizing the information from reviews with business associated data, like sales and seasonal trends, the future planning of different games could use a systematic architecture for targeting different audiences for future sales. Recommendation systems on the business website could use this data to promote additional purchases from the consumers (Ireland and Liu, 2018). Ultimately, this could lead to more sales and profit for the business by maximizing the use of data for intelligent business.
